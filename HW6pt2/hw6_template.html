<h1>Homework 6 pt 2: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>
<h2>Emily Ormond</h2>
<h3>This is a map of Connecticut seperated into its counties. The color indicates the ratio of science and engineering degrees out of people aged 25 and older with a bachelors degree or higher. The darker the color the larger the ratio of science and engineering degrees. The three different maps below represent three different modes of categorizing data.</h3>

<h2>Natural Breaks</h2>
<h4>The pros of using natural breaks to catagorize data is that it reduces variance between clusters. The cons of using to catagoriize data is that the numbers can vary greatly in the ranges in the key</h4>

<h2>Equal Count</h2>
<h4>The pros of using equal count to catagorize data is that it is good for comparing above and below the median. The cons of using equal count to catagoriize data is that it makes it difficult to see clusters.</h4>

<h2>Equal Interval</h2>
<h4>The pros of using equal interval to catagorize data is that it is easy to read and initally see where the highest ratio is. The cons of using equal interval to catagoriize data is that if a majority of the data falls in a number range you cannot see discrepancies between them.</h4>
