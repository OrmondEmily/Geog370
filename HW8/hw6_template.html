<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
<h2>Emily Ormond</h2>
<h3>The question I wanted to answer by making this map was what area that are reserved for bird conservation are being polluted by noise pollution from wind turbines. I choose Iowa because Iowa produces the 2nd most wind turbine energy (second to Texas but they did not have accessible bird conservation data). Although windturnbines provide us with clean renewable energy one of the setbacks are their effect of surrounding ecosystems such as bird populations. I used a buffer of 1000 feet around each windturbine data point becasue that is how far noise pollution from a wind turbine can travel. I then performed a interect of this area and the conserved bird areas to find area of the wind turbines that would interfer with conserved bird habitats. I then clipped each layer by the state of Iowa so that there was no data laying outside of the state on the map.   </h3>
